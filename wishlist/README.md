# Wishlist

This folder contains topics I'd like to do more on, but haven't yet had time.  It's also a place to compile research and start organizing ideas, even if there's not yet a narrative to wrap around it, yet. Some of the topics are:

* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Volumes](volumes.md)
* Linking docker containers
* PaaS services (Deis, Shipyard, etc)
* Scaling docker containers (Mesos, Kubernetes, etc)
* [Fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet)
